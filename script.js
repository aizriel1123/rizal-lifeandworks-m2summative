                    <h4>National Hero of the Philippines</h4>
                    <p>José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) 
                    was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period.
                    He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to 
                    be so by Philippine national hero committee.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Renaissance Man</h4>
                    <p>Rizal was a versatile genius who excelled in numerous fields: ophthalmologist, sculptor, painter, 
                    educator, farmer, historian, playwright, and journalist. He mastered and contributed significantly 
                    to the arts and sciences while advocating for reforms in the Philippines.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Literary Legacy</h4>
                    <p>His two most famous novels, Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not, 1887) and El Filibusterismo 
                    (The Reign of Greed, 1891), exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and awakened 
                    Filipino national consciousness. These works became instrumental in inspiring the Philippine Revolution.</p>

                   <h4>Intelligence and Aptitude</h4>
                    <p>Rizal inherited exceptional intellectual capacity from both sides of his family. 
                    His mother, Doña Teodora Alonso, became Rizal's first teacher and was highly educated and cultured. 
                    She taught him to read at age three, fostering his love of learning and literature.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Artistic Inclinations</h4>
                    <p>His family exhibited strong artistic and creative tendencies, which manifested in Rizal's talents
                     in drawing, sculpture, poetry, and music. During his time at Ateneo, he studied painting under Augusto
                      Saez, a famous Spanish painter, and under Romualdo de Jesus, a noted Filipino sculptor.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Family Background</h4>
                    <p>Rizal came from a prosperous family with progressive values. His father Francisco Mercado modeled 
                    integrity and stood against oppression. Growing up with nine sisters and one brother in a close-knit
                    family instilled values of loyalty, education, and faith.</p>

                    <h4>Stature and Presence</h4>
                    <p>Despite standing only 5 feet 3 inches tall, Rizal possessed a commanding presence through his confidence
                     and intellectual bearing. His physical limitations may have directed his energies toward intellectual 
                     rather than military pursuits.</p>
                    
                       <h4>Health and Medical Practice</h4>
                <p>Rizal's awareness of physical health deepened his commitment to medicine. During his exile in Dapitan, 
                he practiced as a doctor, rendering free services to the poor and providing medicines which he concocted
                 from his knowledge of the curative value of local medicinal plants. His wealthier patients came from other 
                 parts of Mindanao, Laguna, Cebu, Panay, Negros, and even from Hong Kong.</p>
                
                <h4>Mother's Surgery</h4>
                <p>In Calamba during his first homecoming (1887), Doña Teodora became his first patient when he opened a 
                medical clinic to treat her failing eyesight. Later, during his exile in Dapitan (August 1893), she underwent
                 another surgical operation on her right eye and stayed with Rizal for one and a half years.</p>
                
                <h4>Athletic Pursuits</h4>
                <p>Rizal introduced European sports to the youth. In Calamba, he opened a gymnasium where he taught gymnastics,
                 fencing, and shooting to discourage cockfighting and gambling. In Dapitan, he encouraged his pupils to engage
                  in arnis, gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, stone throwing, swimming, and boating.</p>

            strict tutelage of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz. Here he learned discipline and classical education.</p>
            
            <h4>Formal Lessons</h4>
            <p>Young Rizal acquired formal lessons in Latin and Spanish, which would become instrumental in his

            <h4>A Defining Moment</h4>
            <p>On February 17, 1872, the martyrdom of three Filipino priests—Mariano Gomez, José Burgos, and 
            Jacinto Zamora (GOMBURZA)—for alleged involvement in the Cavite Mutiny deeply affected eleven-year-old 
            Rizal.</p>
            
            <h4>Awakening of National Consciousness</h4>
            <p>This injustice awakened his nationalistic consciousness and distrust of colonial authorities. 
            Doña Teodora, afraid of what happened to GOMBURZA, later opposed Rizal's decision to pursue higher 
            studies, fearing "if he gets to know more, the Spaniards would cut his head."</p>
            
            <h4>Colonial Oppression</h4>
            <p>Rizal witnessed firsthand the abuses of Spanish friars and civil authorities: arbitrary arrests, 
            land grabbing, discrimination against native Filipinos, and denial of civil liberties.</p>

            <p>From 1872 to 1877, Rizal attended Ateneo Municipal where he excelled under the Jesuit education 
            system, which emphasized character formation, critical thinking, and competition. He graduated as 
            valedictorian with a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>
            
            <h4>Use of Surname "Rizal"</h4>
            <p>It was during his Ateneo days where he used the surname "Rizal" instead of Mercado to avoid the 
            wrath and suspicion of Spanish authorities.</p>
            
            <h4>Notable Professors</h4>
            <p>Fr. José Bech was his first professor, while Fr. Francisco de Paula Sanchez became one of his 
            best professors, described as "a model of uprightness, earnestness, and devotion." With his aid, 
            Rizal studied mathematics, rhetoric, and Greek.</p>
            
            <h4>Artistic Development</h4>
            <p>He studied painting under Augusto Saez, a famous Spanish painter, and under Romualdo de Jesus, 
            a noted Filipino sculptor. He carved the Image of the Virgin Mary on batikuling wood using a 
            pocketknife.</p>
            
            <h4>Literary Beginnings</h4>
            <p>In 1874, Rizal wrote "Mi Primera Inspiracion" (My First Inspiration), his first poem dedicated 
            to Doña Teodora on his birthday after her release from prison.</p>

            <p>After graduating from Ateneo, Rizal enrolled in Philosophy and Letters at the University of Santo 
            Tomas. He also took vocational courses in agriculture and surveying at Ateneo.</p>
            
            <h4>Surveying Degree</h4>
            <p>At 17, he finished his surveying course, but the degree of Perito Agrimensor (expert surveyor)

            <h4>Shift to Medicine</h4>
            <p>With the advice of Fr. Pablo Ramon, Rizal decided to take up medicine after a year of studying 
            Philosophy and Letters, primarily to treat his mother's failing eyesight.</p>
            
            <h4>Prize-Winning Works</h4>
            <p>In 1879, he wrote "A La Juventud Filipina" (To the Filipino Youth), winning first prize in a 
            contest by Liceo Artistico Literario de Manila. In 1880, he wrote "El Consejo de los Dioses" 
            (The Council of the Gods), again winning first prize despite discrimination from the Spanish community.</p>
            
            <h4>Racial Discrimination</h4>
            <p>Rizal experienced discrimination and witnessed the limitations of Dominican education. The prevailing 
            racial discrimination and antiquated teaching methods frustrated him, motivating his eventual departure 
            for Europe.</p>

            <p>On August 5, 1887, Rizal arrived in Manila after traveling from Rome via Marseilles and Saigon. 
            His reasons for returning included: operating on his mother's failing eyesight, serving his countrymen, 
            learning how his novel Noli affected Filipinos and Spaniards, and finding out why Leonor Rivera had 
            been silent.</p>
            
            <h4>Medical Practice and Gymnasium</h4>
            <p>In Calamba, he opened a medical clinic with Doña Teodora as his first patient. He also opened a 
            gymnasium where he introduced European sports like gymnastics, fencing, and shooting to discourage 
            cockfighting and gambling.</p>
            
            <h4>Noli Controversy</h4>
            <p>Archbishop Pedro Payo became a staunch critic of Noli. A University of Santo Tomas committee 
            declared the book "heretical, impious, scandalous" and recommended absolute prohibition. Fray Jose 
            Rodriguez published 8 pamphlets attacking the Noli. Fr. Vicente Garcia defended it under the pen 
            name Justo Desiderio Manalang.</p>
            
            <h4>Government Protection</h4>
            <p>Liberal-minded Governor General Emilio Terrero assigned Don Jose Taviel de Andrada as Rizal's 
            personal bodyguard, sensing his life was in danger from friars.</p>
            
            <h4>Calamba Agrarian Unrest</h4>
            <p>On January 8, 1888, Rizal submitted a bold expose with signatures of tenants against the Dominican 
            hacienda, documenting increasing rentals, high interest rates, and expulsion of tenants. This earned 
            the ire of the friars.</p>

            <h4>Leaving the Philippines</h4>
            <p>On February 3, 1888, with Governor Terrero's advice, Rizal was forced to leave the country 
            for his safety and that of his family. Before leaving, he wrote "Hymno al Trabajo" (Hymn to Labor) 
            for the town of Lipa's elevation to villa status.</p>
            
            <h4>Hong Kong</h4>
            <p>Rizal arrived in Hong Kong aboard the Zafiro, observing it as "a small but very clean city" with 
            many Portuguese, Hindus, English, and Jews. He noted poor Filipino exiles from the Marianas.</p>
            
            <h4>Macau</h4>
            <p>He visited the Portuguese colony of Macau, describing it as "small, low and gloomy...sad and 
            almost gloomy."</p>
            
            <h4>Japan - Romantic Interlude</h4>
            <p>Rizal arrived in Yokohama on February 28, 1888. Juan Perez Caballero, Secretary of the Spanish 
            Legation, monitored his movements. Rizal stayed at the Spanish Legation to economize. He was 
            enchanted by Japan's beauty, safety (few thieves, rare beggars), and charm. His 45-day stay was 
            one of the happiest interludes in his life.</p>
            
            <h4>Journey to America</h4>
            <p>On April 13, 1888, Rizal left Yokohama aboard the Belgic for the United States. He acted as 
            interpreter for fellow passenger Tetcho Suehiro, a Japanese novelist and human rights champion.</p>

            <p>On April 28, 1888, Rizal first saw America in San Francisco. He and Chinese coolies were quarantined 
            for a week due to "cholera outbreak" in China—actually motivated by upcoming presidential elections 
            to gain white votes by impeding Chinese workers.</p>
            
            <h4>New York</h4>
            <p>On May 13, 1888, Rizal reached New York. After 3 days, he left for Liverpool on May 16 aboard 
            "City of Rome," the second largest ship in the world.</p>
            
            <h4>Mixed Impressions</h4>
            <p>During President Grover Cleveland's administration, Rizal observed America's material progress, 
            natural beauty, and opportunities, but noted the absence of racial equality and "true civil liberty." 
            He observed discrimination against Chinese and Negroes, noting "America is the land par excellence 
            of freedom but only for the whites."</p>

            <p>On May 24, 1888, Rizal arrived in Liverpool from New York. He chose London to improve his English 
            and to study Antonio de Morga's "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas" (1609) at the British Museum.</p>
            
            <h4>Annotating Morga</h4>
            <p>Rizal wanted to show that pre-colonial Filipinos had developed culture. In his September 17, 1888 
            letter to Blumentritt, he praised Morga's work as "scholarly, without superficiality and exaggeration, 
            very simple."</p>
            
            <h4>Residence</h4>
            <p>He briefly stayed with Antonio Ma. Regidor, a Filipino lawyer exiled after the 1872 GOMBURZA 
            martyrdom, then transferred to 37 Charlotte Crescent St., Primrose Hill.</p>

            <p>During the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition, Rizal founded the Kidlat Club, a social society with 
            members including the Luna Brothers, Gregorio Aguilera, Fernando Canon, Lauro Dimayuga, Julio Llorente, 
            and Baldomero Roxas.</p>
            
            <h4>Indios Bravos</h4>
            <p>Inspired by American Indians at the Buffalo Bull exhibition proudly displaying their culture, 
            Rizal formed "Indios Bravos" to replace Kidlat Club. Members pledged to excel in intellectual and 
            physical prowess, practicing sword, pistol, and judo.</p>
            
            <h4>Sociedad R.D.L.M.</h4>
            <p>Rizal formed this secret society patterned after Free Masonry for "propagating useful scientific, 
            artistic and literary knowledge in the Philippines." RDLM stood for "Redencion de Los Malayos" 
            (Redemption of the Malay Race).</p>
            
            <h4>Failed College Project</h4>
            <p>Rizal conceived opening a modern Filipino college in Hong Kong. Mariano Cunanan promised to help 
            raise P40,000 as initial capital, but the project did not materialize.</p>

            <p>While in Brussels, Rizal criticized Filipinos in Madrid for excessive gambling, saying "instead 
            of being worthy of liberty, we are worthy of slavery." Angered gamblers called him "Papa (Pope)" 
            instead of Pepe.</p>
            
            <h4>Family Misfortunes</h4>
            <p>Rizal went to Madrid to appeal the agrarian case against the Dominicans before the Spanish Supreme 
            Court, asking M.H. Del Pilar for legal services. They lost the case. His brother Paciano and brothers-in-law 
            were deported to Mindoro and Bohol.</p>
            
            <h4>Retana Controversy</h4>
            <p>Wenceslao Retana, press agent of Spanish friars and Rizal's bitter enemy, wrote about the Mercados' 
            ejection from Dominican estates. Rizal challenged him to a duel, demanding blood or apology.</p>
            
            <h4>Leonor's Marriage and Rivalry</h4>
            <p>Leonor Rivera married an Englishman chosen by her mother. Rivalry between Rizal and M.H. Del Pilar 
            resulted in Rizal's departure from Madrid.</p>
            
            <h4>Completing El Filibusterismo</h4>
            <p>In 1891, Rizal completed his second novel "El Filibusterismo" (The Reign of Greed), darker in 
            tone than Noli Me Tangere, depicting revolution though he personally remained committed to non-violent 
            change.</p>

            <p>On Christmas Day 1891, Rizal's parents and siblings in exile gathered in Hong Kong, "far from 
            persecution suffered in the Philippines." Rizal wrote to Blumentritt: "Life in the Philippines has 
            become impossible without courtesy, without virtue, without justice."</p>
            
            <h4>Medical Practice</h4>
            <p>Rizal opened a clinic and practiced medicine with help from Portuguese friend Dr. Lorenzo P. Marquez. 
            He became a well-known medical practitioner in the British crown colony. His brother Paciano translated 
            Noli into Tagalog.</p>
            
            <h4>Borneo Colonization Project</h4>
            <p>On March 7, 1892, Rizal went to Sandakan to negotiate with British North Borneo Company representatives. 
            He was granted permission to establish a settlement on 190,000 acres in Maradu Bay for 999 years. 
            However, brother-in-law Manuel Hidalgo objected, and Governor General Despujol disapproved, citing 
            manpower shortage and impracticality.</p>
            
            <h4>Planning La Liga Filipina</h4>
            <p>While in Hong Kong, Rizal wrote the constitution for La Liga Filipina, a patriotic organization

            <p>In May 1892, Rizal decided to return to confer his Borneo project with Governor Despujol, establish 
            La Liga Filipina, and disprove Eduardo de Lete's claims that he abandoned the country's cause.</p>
            
            <h4>Spanish Duplicity</h4>
            <p>Rizal sent a third letter to Despujol requesting protection. Together with sister Lucia, he was 
            issued a special passport by the Spanish Consul-General in Hong Kong. Immediately after his departure 
            on June 21, 1892, the Consul-General cabled Despujol: "the victim is in the trap." A case was filed 
            against Rizal for "anti-religious and anti-patriotic agitation."</p>
            
            <h4>Founding La Liga Filipina</h4>
            <p>On July 3, 1892, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina at the house of Doroteo Ongjunco on Ilaya Street, 
            Tondo, Manila.</p>
            
            <h4>Arrest</h4>
            <p>On July 6, 1892, Rizal went to Malacañang to meet Governor General Despujol. He was confronted 
            with charges of bringing "Pobres Frailes" leaflets from Hong Kong and dedicating El Fili to GOMBURZA.</p>

            <h4>Arrival in Dapitan</h4>
            <p>On July 17, 1892, at 7:00 PM, Rizal arrived as an exile in Dapitan, a remote town in Mindanao 
            under Jesuit missionary jurisdiction. He carried a recommendation letter from Fr. Pablo Pastells 
            to Fr. Antonio Obach requiring him to retract errors, make pro-Spanish statements, and conduct 
            himself in exemplary manner.</p>
            
            <h4>Rejecting Conditions</h4>
            <p>Rizal did not agree with the conditions and opted to live with Captain Ricardo Carnicero, the 
            politico-military governor. Their relationship was warm and friendly. On August 26, 1892, Rizal 
            wrote "A Don Ricardo Carnicero" for the Captain's birthday and molded a bust.</p>
            
            <h4>Lottery Win and Land Purchase</h4>
            <p>After winning P6,200 in a lottery with Francisco Equillor and Ricardo Carnicero, Rizal purchased 
            land near the town plaza and 16 hectares in Talisay where he built a house, school, and clinic. 
            His total property of 70 hectares was planted with coconuts, sugar cane, corn, coffee, cacao, and 
            fruit trees.</p>
            
            <h4>Medical Practice</h4>
            <p>Rizal rendered free services to the poor with self-concocted medicines from local plants. Wealthier 
            patients came from Mindanao, Laguna, Cebu, Panay, Negros, and Hong Kong. George Taufer brought 
            adopted daughter Josephine Bracken for ophthalmology expertise. In August 1893, Doña Teodora underwent 
            another eye surgery and stayed one and a half years. He constructed "Casitas de Salud" for patients 
            and families.</p>
            
            <h4>Engineering and Community Development</h4>
            <p>Using his Perito Agrimensor knowledge, Rizal planned new street layouts. He designed a water system 
            completed in 1895 using discarded roof tiles, bricks, gin bottles, and stones. He drained marshes 
            to minimize malaria, created a relief map of Mindanao in the town plaza, and provided lighting 
            with coconut oil lamps.</p>
            
            <h4>School for Boys</h4>
            <p>In 1893, Rizal established a school for 16 selected boys in his "Casa Cuadrada," offering free 
            vocational education. Classes ran 2-4 PM daily, teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, 
            Spanish, English, geography, and good conduct. Field trips provided working knowledge of flora and 
            fauna. Pupils helped in his clinic and farms, learning better agricultural methods. During recess, 
            they engaged in arnis, gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, stone throwing, swimming, and boating.</p>
            
            <h4>Scientific Research</h4>
            <p>Rizal explored Dapitan's jungles and seacoast, collecting specimens sent to Dresden Museum in 
            Germany. In exchange, European scientists sent scientific books and surgical instruments. Three 
            rare specimens were named after him: Draco rizali (Flying Dragon), Apogonia rizali (Small Beetle), 
            and Rhacophorus rizali (Rare Frog).</p>
            
            <h4>Business Ventures</h4>
            <p>With Ramon Carreon as partner, Rizal made profitable ventures in fishing, copra, and abaca to 
            curb Chinese trade control. On January 19, 1893, he requested his brother-in-law Manuel Hidalgo 
            to send a fishing trawl and two Calamba fishermen to teach better fishing methods. He trained local 
            fishermen and taught net weaving. He promoted a Dapitan farmers cooperative association for improving 
            farm products and cooperative marketing.</p>
            
            <h4>Poetry - Mi Retiro</h4>
            <p>During Doña Teodora's stay, she requested poetry from her son. On October 22, 1895, Rizal sent 
            "Mi Retiro" (My Retreat), a 25-stanza poem describing his serene exile life, acclaimed as one of 
            his best poems.</p>
            
            <h4>Josephine Bracken</h4>
            <p>Rizal fell in love with Josephine Bracken, adopted daughter of his patient George Taufer. They 
            agreed to marry but Fr. Obach refused to perform the ceremony. Taufer opposed the romance and nearly 
            committed suicide. Josephine stayed in Manila with the Rizals, then returned to Dapitan living with 
            Jose as "husband and wife" out of wedlock. In early 1896, they expected a baby, but Josephine 
            prematurely gave birth to an 8-month baby who survived only three hours. The son was named Francisco 
            and buried in Dapitan.</p>
            
            <h4>Katipunan Meeting</h4>
            <p>On June 21, 1896, Dr. Pio Valenzuela visited Rizal in Dapitan to inform him of the Katipunan 
            (founded July 7, 1892) and its revolutionary aim. Valenzuela brought blind man Raymundo Mata as 
            cover. Rizal considered the resolutions just but objected to premature revolution, calling it 
            "veritable suicide." He cited the Cuban revolution's costly attempts. Rizal stressed preventing 
            "premature flow of blood" and suggested getting support from rich Manila sectors and appointing 
            Antonio Luna to direct military maneuvers. He disapproved plans to rescue him from imprisonment, 
            having given his word of honor. Rizal said: "To die and conquer is pleasant but to die and be 
            conquered is painful" and warned: "The slaves of today would be tyrants of tomorrow."</p>
            
            <h4>Cuba Volunteer Plan</h4>
            <p>Despite liberties in Dapitan, Rizal was not free. In 1894 he sought pardon from Governor General 
            Ramon Blanco; in 1895 he requested release and case review. He then offered to serve as military 
            doctor in Cuba where yellow fever epidemic raged. When Valenzuela objected due to Valeriano Weyler 
            (who banished his family) being general in Cuba, Rizal revealed his true intention: to study war 
            practically and learn how to start revolution in the Philippines.</p>
            
            <h4>End of Exile</h4>
            <p>On July 31, 1896, Governor Blanco's approval for Rizal to go to Cuba marked the end of his 
            4-year exile. He expressed joy in "El Canto del Viajero" (Song of the Traveler). At midnight 
            July 31, Rizal, Josephine, sisters Josefa and Narcisa, niece Angelica, 3 nephews, and 6 pupils 
            boarded steamer España. Almost all Dapitan folks came to bid farewell as the town brass band 
            played Chopin's Funeral March. As the ship departed, Rizal gazed at Dapitan for the last time 
            and wrote in his diary: "I have been in that district for four years, 13 days and few hours."</p>

            <p>In August 1896, the Philippine Revolution erupted. Despite his non-involvement and advocacy for 
            peaceful reform, Spanish authorities arrested Rizal, accusing him of inspiring the rebellion through 
            his writings.</p>

            <h4>Prophetic Diary Entry</h4>
            <p>During his return trip, Rizal wrote an accurate prognosis in his diary on October 8, 1896: 
            "I think that God is doing me good by allowing me to return to the Philippines in order to disprove 
            so many charges against me. Either they will give me justice and acknowledge my innocence, then I 
            shall have all my rights restored, or they will condemn me to death and then I shall have expiated 
            my supposed crime in the society. She will forgive me later, and without any doubt, I shall be 
            given justice, and become a martyr more."</p>
            
            <h4>Arrival in Manila</h4>
            <p>On November 3, 1896, Rizal arrived in Manila and was brought directly to Fort Santiago under

            <h4>Manifesto Against Revolution</h4>
            <p>While imprisoned in Fort Santiago, Rizal issued a manifesto disavowing the current revolution, 
            declaring that education of Filipinos and achievement of national identity were prerequisites to 
            freedom.</p>
            
            <h4>Mock Trial</h4>
            <p>Rizal was tried before a court-martial for rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy. His legal counsel 
            was Luis Taviel de Andrade. The trial was predetermined—he was denied proper defense and presumed 
            guilty. Though he disavowed violent revolution and sought reforms within Spanish rule, his novels 
            and reputation made him a convenient scapegoat.</p>
            
            <h4>Political Changes</h4>
            <p>Governor General Blanco, who was sympathetic to Rizal, had been forced out of office. The friars, 
            led by Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda, pressured Queen-Regent Maria Cristina of Spain to install 
            Camilo de Polavieja as new Governor General, sealing Rizal's fate.</p>
            
            <h4>Death Sentence</h4>
            <p>On December 26, 1896, Rizal was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to death.</p>

        content: `
            <h4>24 Hours to Live</h4>
            <p>On December 29, after the death sentence was read, Rizal had only 24 hours to live. He sent a 
            note to his family: "I would like to see some of you before I die; though it may be very painful, 
            let the bravest one come. I have some important things to say."</p>
            
            <h4>Final Letters</h4>
            <p>To Blumentritt: "When you receive this letter, I shall be dead. I shall be shot tomorrow at seven 
            o'clock. But I am innocent of the crime of rebellion. I am going to die with a clear conscience." 
            To Paciano: "To tell you how much I regret to leave you alone in life bearing all the weight of the 
            family... if the fruit has been bitter, it is not my fault, it is a fault of circumstances." He 
            asked forgiveness from his father and asked his mother to seek permission to bury his body.</p>
            
            <h4>Final Gifts and Mi Último Adiós</h4>
            <p>Rizal gave final gifts: handkerchief to Angelica, wicker chair to Narcisa, belt and watch to 
            Mauricio, and alcohol burner to Trinidad. As he handed the burner to Trinidad, he whispered "There 
            is something on it"—his final poem "Mi Último Adiós" smuggled as his last message to his people.</p>
            
            <h4>Retraction</h4>
            <p>On December 29, Rizal signed a retraction prepared by Fr. Pio Pi: "I declare myself a Catholic, 
            and in this religion in which I was born and educated I wish to live and die. I retract with all 
            my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications and conduct has been contrary to my conditions 
            as a son of the Church."</p>
            
            <h4>Marriage to Josephine</h4>
            <p>At around 5:00 AM on December 30, 1896, Rizal and Josephine Bracken married in a ceremony without 
            lengthy formalities. Fr. Balaguer pronounced them husband and wife. Rizal gave Josephine his book 
            "Imitation of Christ" with dedication: "To My dear and unhappy wife, 30 December 1896."</p>
            
            <h4>Execution at Bagumbayan</h4>
            <p>At dawn, December 30, 1896, dressed in black, Rizal was escorted to Luneta de Bagumbayan by 
            Luis Taviel de Andrade, Fr. Jose Villaclara, and Estanislao March. His request to be shot in 
            front was denied; his request that his head be spared was granted. At the order "Fuego!" a volley 
            rang out. As bullets pierced him, Rizal tried to turn and fell at Bagumbayan Field (now Luneta Park). 
            He was 35 years old.</p>
            
            <h4>Transformation into Symbol</h4>
            <p>His martyrdom transformed him from reform advocate into revolutionary symbol. His death united 
            disparate groups and intensified the revolution, paradoxically achieving through death what his 
            life's work of peaceful reform could not. His execution proved more effective than his writings 
            in legitimizing the Filipino struggle for independence.</p>

                content: `
                    <h4>Intellectual Brilliance</h4>
                    <p>Rizal mastered 22 languages and excelled in medicine, literature, arts, and sciences. His polymath 
                    abilities enabled him to communicate ideas across cultures and disciplines, making his advocacy 
                    intellectually unassailable.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Moral Courage</h4>
                    <p>Despite knowing the risks, Rizal published works criticizing Spanish rule. He returned to the 
                    Philippines in 1892 knowing arrest was likely. His willingness to face danger for his principles exemplified
                     moral bravery.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Dedication to Peaceful Reform</h4>
                    <p>Rizal consistently advocated change through education, enlightenment, and legal reform rather than violence.
                     His commitment to non-violent resistance influenced future independence movements globally.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Compassion and Service</h4>
                    <p>Whether treating patients, teaching students, or helping communities, Rizal demonstrated genuine concern
                     for ordinary Filipinos. His actions matched his rhetoric, earning respect across social classes.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Discipline and Work Ethic</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's prolific output—novels, essays, poetry, scientific papers—resulted from extraordinary discipline.
                     He maximized every opportunity for learning and productivity, even during exile.</p>

                content: `
                    <h4>Idealism vs. Reality</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's faith in Spanish authorities' willingness to grant reforms proved naive. His belief that 
                    enlightenment alone could overturn centuries of oppression underestimated entrenched colonial interests
                     and the necessity of forceful resistance.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Elitism and Class Bias</h4>
                    <p>As an ilustrado, Rizal sometimes demonstrated class prejudices. He believed reforms should be led by 
                    educated elites, showing limited faith in mass movements. His social circle remained largely confined to
                     educated professionals.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Reluctance Toward Armed Revolution</h4>
                    <p>While his writings inspired revolutionaries, Rizal personally opposed armed uprising. This stance created 
                    tension with revolutionary leaders like Bonifacio. His rejection of violence, though principled, seemed 
                    impractical to those facing immediate oppression.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Personal Relationships</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's romantic life showed indecisiveness and inconsistency. His relationships with multiple women, 
                    including breaking engagement with Leonor Rivera, revealed emotional complexity and sometimes questionable 
                    judgment in personal matters.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Political Naivety</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's volunteering as military doctor for Cuba and belief that loyalty to Spain might earn Filipino 
                    rights showed political miscalculation. He underestimated Spanish authorities' determination to maintain 
                    colonial control at any cost.</p>

                    <h4>From Privileged Youth to Social Critic</h4>
                    <p>Young Rizal enjoyed class privileges and excellent education. Gradually, witnessing injustices and 
                    studying abroad, he evolved from beneficiary of the colonial system to its most articulate critic.</p>
                    
                    <h4>From Reformist to Revolutionary Symbol</h4>
                    <p>Rizal began advocating reforms within Spanish rule—representation in Cortes, Filipino priests, educational access.
                     By Filibusterismo, his tone darkened, though he never personally embraced armed revolution. His execution completed
                      his transformation into revolutionary icon.</p>
                    
                    <h4>From Idealist to Pragmatist</h4>
                    <p>Early writings showed optimism that reason and enlightenment would triumph. Later works and experiences in
                    Dapitan revealed growing awareness of reform's limitations, though he maintained commitment to non-violence.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Deepening National Consciousness</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's identity evolved from "Spanish Filipino" seeking equal rights within empire to "Filipino" nationalist 
                    envisioning an independent national identity. His historical research and writings helped construct Filipino national
                     consciousness.</p>

                    <h4>Colonial Oppression and Surveillance</h4>
                    <p>Rizal lived under constant Spanish surveillance. His writings were banned, his movements restricted, and his 
                    family persecuted. The colonial state used its full power to silence and intimidate him.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Exile and Isolation</h4>
                    <p>Four years in Dapitan separated Rizal from intellectual circles, political developments, and family. 
                    This isolation tested his resolve and limited his direct influence on the emerging revolutionary movement.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Internal Movement Conflicts</h4>
                    <p>Rizal faced criticism from fellow reformists who deemed him too radical and from revolutionaries who considered 
                    him too moderate. His middle path pleased neither extreme, leaving him politically isolated.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Financial Hardships</h4>
                    <p>Despite family wealth, Rizal often struggled financially, especially during European travels. 
                    He relied on family support and took odd jobs, experiencing economic vulnerability that deepened his empathy 
                    for struggling Filipinos.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Personal Sacrifices</h4>
                    <p>Rizal sacrificed romantic relationships, family closeness, professional advancement, and ultimately life itself. 
                    His commitment to the Filipino cause required abandoning personal happiness and security.</p>

                    <h4>Writing as Weapon</h4>
                    <p>Facing censorship and persecution, Rizal transformed obstacles into motivation. His novels became weapons more 
                    powerful than swords, awakening Filipino consciousness and exposing colonial injustices to international audiences.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Service Despite Exile</h4>
                    <p>Rather than despair in Dapitan, Rizal served his community—teaching, healing, building infrastructure. 
                    He demonstrated that heroism lies not in grand gestures but in daily dedication to improving others' lives.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Principled Non-Violence</h4>
                    <p>Despite pressure to support armed revolution and facing execution for allegedly inspiring it, Rizal maintained
                     his commitment to peaceful reform. His principled stance, though criticized, influenced future non-violent 
                     resistance movements worldwide.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Dignified Martyrdom</h4>
                    <p>Facing death, Rizal refused to recant his beliefs or blame others. He accepted martyrdom with dignity, 
                    transforming his execution into his most powerful statement. His death united Filipinos across classes and regions.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Legacy of Inspiration</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's obstacles and responses created a heroic narrative that continues inspiring Filipinos. His life 
                    demonstrates that heroism emerges from facing adversity with integrity, courage, and unwavering commitment 
                    to one's principles and people.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Ultimate Sacrifice</h4>
                    <p>Rizal's willingness to die for his ideals completed his transformation from reformist intellectual to 
                    national hero. His martyrdom proved more effective than his life's work in uniting Filipinos and legitimizing
                     their struggle for independence. The very pitfalls he encountered—persecution, exile, execution—became the
                     foundation of his enduring heroism.</p>
