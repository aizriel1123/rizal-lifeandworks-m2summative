                <strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> José Rizal's character and heroism were shaped by a complex interplay of biological inheritance and environmental influences, including his family's values, educational experiences, and the socio-political context of colonial Philippines. His virtues of intellectual brilliance and moral courage, combined with the challenges and pitfalls he faced, ultimately contributed to his emergence as a national hero and martyr for Philippine independence.

                <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
                <p>José Rizal's development as a patriot and hero was the result of multiple intersecting factors. Biologically, he inherited intelligence and physical characteristics that enabled his pursuits. Environmentally, his family's progressive values, quality education, and exposure to enlightenment ideals shaped his worldview. His experiences abroad broadened his perspective, while his exile in Dapitan revealed both his dedication to service and his isolation from revolutionary movements.</p>
                
                <p>His character demonstrated remarkable virtues including intellectual brilliance, moral courage, linguistic ability, and dedication to peaceful reform. However, he also possessed shortcomings such as idealism that sometimes conflicted with practical realities, elitism in his social circles, and reluctance to embrace armed revolution. These very weaknesses, paradoxically, contributed to his heroism by making his sacrifice more poignant and his example more universal.</p>
                
                <h3>Reflection on Rizal's Legacy</h3>
                <p>Rizal's legacy transcends his lifetime. His writings awakened Filipino consciousness and provided intellectual foundations for independence. His martyrdom united diverse groups and inspired revolutionary action. His life demonstrates that heroism emerges not from perfection but from the courage to act according to one's principles despite personal cost.</p>
                
                <p>Today, Rizal remains relevant as a symbol of intellectual resistance, moral integrity, and love of country. His character development from privileged youth to national martyr illustrates how both nature and nurture contribute to greatness, and how even flawed individuals can inspire generations through dedication to noble ideals and willingness to sacrifice for the greater good.</p>
